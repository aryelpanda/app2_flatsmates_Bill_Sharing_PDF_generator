Project Name: Flatmate Bill Calculator

This project utilizes the FPDF library in Python to generate a PDF report that calculates and displays the bill amount for two flatmates. By implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the application asks for the names of the flatmates, their respective lengths of stay, and the total bill amount. It then computes the amount each flatmate needs to pay based on their proportionate time spent in the house and generates a PDF document with the detailed payment breakdown.
Features and Functionality

    Object-Oriented Programming: The project is built using OOP concepts, providing an organized structure and allowing for extensibility and code reusability.
    User Input: The application prompts the user to enter the names of the flatmates, their time of stay in the house, and the total bill amount.
    Calculation: The app calculates the amount each flatmate needs to pay by dividing the bill proportionately based on their length of stay.
    PDF Generation: The calculated payment breakdown is then displayed in a PDF report, providing a clear overview for the flatmates.

Future Improvements

To further enhance the project, you could consider implementing the following additional features:

    Error Handling: Add robust error handling to handle invalid user inputs and prevent the application from crashing.
    Unit Tests: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the calculations and ensure the code functions as expected.
    GUI: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more user-friendly experience, allowing users to input data through a visually appealing interface.
    Database Integration: Implement a database system to store flatmate information, bill details, and payment records for future reference.
